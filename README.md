# SortedBag-BinarySearchTree

Implementation of basic functions of SortedBag Collection using Binary Search Tree.

What I learnt from this project:
- Collections library
- how ADTs implemented using Binary Search Tree work
- when and why this type of ADT implementation should be used
- more pointers and HEAP memory
